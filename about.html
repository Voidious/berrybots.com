    <p>BerryBots tries to follow in the footsteps of
    <a href="http://robocode.sourceforge.net">Robocode</a>,
    <a href="http://www.robotbattle.com">Robot Battle</a>,
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language)">Logo</a>,
    and many other great programming games. You "play" these games by writing
    code to control a bot that moves around the screen. They're often used in
    educational settings because they're a great way to make learning to code a 
    fun and interesting experience.</p>
    <p>BerryBots' origins can be traced back to
    <a href="http://robowiki.net/?Raspberry_Pi">a discussion at the RoboWiki</a>,
    a plea from a legendary Robocoder to take Robocode and package it nicely for
    the Raspberry Pi, or perhaps create a new, lightweight
    version of it. At the time, it sounded like a daunting task. But a few
    months later, I got Raspberry Pi fever, and a few folks tried running stock
    Robocode on it and saw pretty bad performance. I ordered one with the intent
    to start tinkering with a new programming game, with the Raspberry Pi as the
    initial target platform.</p>
    <p>I began with the goal of creating a lightweight, somewhat simplified,
    Robocode-esque game with good performance on the Raspberry Pi. What I ended
    up with is a lightweight, flexible game that runs plenty fast enough on the
    Raspberry Pi, has much simpler APIs and game rules than Robocode,
    but also introduces some cool new gameplay elements, like walls, a stage
    that's controlled by a program much as bots are, and a secondary weapon that
    complements both the primary projectile weapon and the presence of walls on
    the stage.</p>

      Robocode and would never have existed without it.</li>
