      <p>BerryBots is a programming game. A player programs a ship that moves around
      the stage, sees gameplay events, and shoots at other ships. The ship API and
      game rules are simple and it's easy to get started in just a few minutes.</p>
      <p>The stage is also configured and controlled by a program, so the gameplay
      on every stage is different. The sample stages include mazes, jousting, a race
      track, several classic arcade style games, and a few battle stages. These only
      scratch the surface of what can be done with the stage API, but you could stay
      busy for quite a while just writing ships for the sample stages.</p>

      <p>Ships and stages are written in <a href="http://www.lua.org">Lua</a>, a
      fast, lightweight, flexible programming language designed to be embedded into
      other programs. BerryBots is currently available for the Raspberry Pi, Mac,
      and Linux.</p>
