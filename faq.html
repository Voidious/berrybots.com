    What is BerryBots?
  </div>
  <div class="faq_a">
    <p>BerryBots is a programming game designed for the Raspberry Pi, and also
    available on other platforms (currently Mac and Linux). It tries hard to
    cater to beginner programmers while retaining a lot of depth for seasoned
    software developers. You can start by trying to navigate your ship through a
    simple maze, fight through custom stages with a wide range of gameplay
    styles, work your way up to battling against other people's ships, or design
    your own gameplay by programming stages.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="faq_q">
    How do I write a bot?
  </div>
  <div class="faq_a">
    <p>Ships are coded in Lua, a lightweight and flexible programming language
    designed for just this type of application, where one program is embedded
    into another. Take a look at the

    What can a ship do?
  </div>
  <div class="faq_a">
    <p>A ship program can...
    <ul>
      <li>...move a ship by firing its thrusters.</li>
      <li>...fire a ship's lasers at enemy ships. Lasers are fast, weak, and
      fly until they hit a ship or a wall.</li>
      <li>...fire a ship's torpedos. Torpedos are strong, slow, move a specific
      distance, move through walls and ships, and then explode, doing damage
      and knockback to all ships within the blast radius.</li>
      <li>...see other ships and certain gameplay events in the field of
      vision of the ships it controls (i.e., no walls in the way).</li>
      <li>...control all ships on a team from a single program, with all ships'
      combined vision. No need for communication between ships to coordinate
      strategy or share information.
      </li>
    </ul>
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="faq_q">
    What can a stage do?
  </div>
  <div class="faq_a">
    <p>A stage program can...
    <ul>
      <li>...configure the stage size, walls, zones, starting points, team size,
      and battle mode, and pre-load stage ships.</li>
      <li>...monitor everything in the game, decide when a round ends, when the
      game is over, and who wins.</li>
      <li>...modify almost everything about ships, including destroying ships,
      reviving ships, moving ships, modifying a ship's speed, heading, or
      energy, and disabling or enabling a ship's thrusters, laser gun, or
      torpedo gun.</li>
      <li>...send custom events to ships to coordinate stage ships or
      communicate gameplay events to player ships.</li>
      <li>...draw text on the screen, such as a scoreboard, number of extra
      lives, congrats when a ship scores a point, or a taunt when a ship is
      destroyed.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="faq_q">
    This looks an awful lot like Robocode / Robot Battle / RoboWar / Logo... ?
  </div>
  <div class="faq_a">
    <p>I'm a huge fan of Robocode. I've probably spent more time writing
    Robocode bots than anyone ever. Robocode was inspired by Robot Battle, which
    drew inspiration from earlier tank battle games... So BerryBots was
    certainly influenced by Robocode and all of its predecessors. I think
    BerryBots brings some cool new stuff to the table and I hope you'll agree.
    (And by all means, check out Robocode and all those other games, too!)</p>
  </div>
  <div class="faq_q">
    What makes BerryBots special?
  </div>
  <div class="faq_a">
    <p>First, it's designed from the ground up to run on the Raspberry Pi. You
    don't need anything besides what comes in Raspbian to get started writing
    and running your bots with a terminal and a text editor. The game engine and
    the Lua programming language are pretty fast and the 2D graphics are GPU
    accelerated with OpenVG. You should have no problem running battles with a
    few moderately complex bots at a smooth 60 frames per second.</p>
    <p>I've gone to great lengths to make BerryBots especially welcoming to
    beginners. Everything about the ship API and game rules is designed to be as
    simple and intuitive as possible. I hope that folks teaching intro
    programming classes, especially on the Raspberry Pi, will consider checking
    out BerryBots. And it should scale smoothly to novice, moderate and advanced
    programmers, competing with each other in battle mode, race tracks, custom
    stages, or designing gameplay on their own stages.</p>
    <p>Perhaps the most unique aspect of BerryBots as compared to other
    programming games is the programmable stage. The stage is a user written
    program loaded at run time, just as ships are. In the stage program, you can
    configure walls, zones, starting points, and pre-loaded ships designed for
    whatever gameplay you have in mind for the stage. The stage gets a chance to
    run code each tick, just as each bot does. It can monitor the game, move
    ships around, change their speed or energy, destroy and revive ships, send
    custom events to ships, write text to the screen, decide who wins and when
    the round or match is over. The sample stages include mazes, a race track,
    jousting, several arcade inspired single player games, as well as battle
    stages designed for 1v1, free-for-all, or team battles. And these only
    scratch the surface of what could be done with the stage API.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="faq_q">
    Is it safe to run other people's bots?
  </div>
  <div class="faq_a">
    <p>You should always be careful running any kind of untrusted code on your
    system. But yes, I've done my best to create a secure sandbox for running
    BerryBots ships and stages. Specifically:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Lua code has no network access in the first place.</li>
      <li>Disabled support for loading LuaJIT bytecode.</li>
      <li>Disabled the Lua/LuaJIT libraries:
      <ul>
        <li><code>io</code> - general filesystem access</li>
        <li><code>os</code> - OS operations, like executing commands</code></li>
        <li><code>debug</code> - various ways of poking around the Lua state</li>
        <li><code>jit</code> - alters settings of the JIT compiler</li>
        <li><code>package.loadlib</code> - directly loads functions from C
        libraries</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Lua's <code>require</code>, <code>loadfile</code>, and
      <code>dofile</code> functions can only load Lua source files from
      BerryBots' data directories.</li>
      <li>Disallow running any packaged ships or stages that contain symbolic
      links.</li>
    </ul>
    
  </div>
  <div class="faq_q">
    Can't you make a nonviolent programming game?
  </div>
  <div class="faq_a">
    <p>I gave some serious thought to avoiding the idea of having bots shoot at
    each other in any way. I decided that the gameplay dynamics of it are just
    too interesting and familiar to gamers to avoid it entitely. That said, I
    have a couple points to offer:
    <ul>
      <li>I've been careful to keep the violence squarely in the "cartoon
      violence" realm. The game uses simple 2D vector graphics. There are no
      detailed explosions or anything photorealistic. Lasers and torpedos are
      not typical real world weapons. Ships don't "die", they are "destroyed"
      (and can be revived!).</li>
      <li>A stage has to enable battle mode to allow ships to shoot at each
      other and a lot can be done with battle mode off. Many of the sample
      stages do not use battle mode - their gameplay is entirely based on ships
      moving around the stage. If you're averse to spaceships shooting each
      other, limit yourself (or your students / children) to these types of
      stages.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="faq_q">
    What version of Lua is BerryBots using?
  </div>
  <div class="faq_a">
    <p>BerryBots uses a modified <a href="http://luajit.org">LuaJIT</a> 2.0.0,
    which itself is a highly optimized version of Lua 5.1 with some features of
    5.2. The changes made for BerryBots are centered on security and packaging
    of ships and stages.
