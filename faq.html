    What is BerryBots?
  </div>
  <div class="faq_a">
    <p>BerryBots is a programming game. You write a Lua program to control a
    ship that competes in challenges or battles against other ships. The stage
    is also a Lua program and it controls many aspects of the gameplay.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="faq_q">
    How do I write a bot?
  </div>
  <div class="faq_a">
    <p>User programs are coded in Lua, a lightweight and flexible programming
    language designed for this type of application, where one program is
    embedded into another. A few resources to get started:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://berrybots.com/wiki/index.php?title=Category:Samples">BerryBots sample programs</a></li>

  <div class="faq_q">
    What can a ship do?
  </div>
  <div class="faq_a">
    <p>A ship program can...
    <ul>
      <li>...move a ship by firing its thrusters.</li>
      <li>...fire a ship's laser gun (primary weapon).</li>
      <li>...fire a ship's torpedo gun (secondary weapon).</li>
      <li>...see other ships and certain gameplay events, based on line of
      sight (i.e., not blocked by walls).</li>
      <li>...control all ships on a team from a single program, with all ships'
      combined vision.
      <li>...draw debugging graphics to the screen.</li>
      </li>
    </ul>
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="faq_q">
    What can a stage do?
  </div>
  <div class="faq_a">
    <p>A stage program can...
    <ul>
      <li>...configure the stage size, walls, zones, starting points, team size,
      battle mode, and stage ships.</li>
      <li>...monitor everything in the game, decide when rounds end, when the
      game is over, and who wins.</li>
      <li>...modify almost everything about ships.</li>
      <li>...send custom events to ships.</li>
      <li>...draw text on the screen.</li>
      <li>...draw debugging graphics to the screen.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="faq_q">
    This looks an awful lot like Robocode / Robot Battle / RoboWar / Logo... ?
  </div>
  <div class="faq_a">
    <p>I'm a huge fan of Robocode. I've probably spent more time writing
    Robocode bots than anyone ever. Robocode was inspired by Robot Battle, which
    drew inspiration from earlier tank battle games... So BerryBots was
    certainly influenced by Robocode and its predecessors. I think BerryBots
    brings some cool new stuff to the table. I hope you'll agree.
    (And by all means, check out Robocode and those other games, too!)</p>
  </div>
  <div class="faq_q">
    What makes BerryBots special?
  </div>
  <div class="faq_a">
    <p>First, it's designed from the ground up to run on the Raspberry Pi. You
    don't need anything besides what comes in Raspbian to get started writing
    and running your bots with a terminal and a text editor. You should have no
    problem running matches with a few moderately complex bots at a smooth 60
    frames per second.</p>
    <p>Perhaps the most unique aspect of BerryBots is the programmable stage.
    The stage is a user written program loaded at run time, just as ships are.
    The stage program dictates much of the BerryBots gameplay. You can see a
    wide range of gameplay styles in the sample stages, and these only
    scratch the surface of what could be done with the stage API.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="faq_q">
    Is it safe to run other people's bots?
  </div>
  <div class="faq_a">
    <p>You should always be careful running any kind of untrusted code on your
    system. But yes, I've done my best to create a secure sandbox for running
    BerryBots ships and stages. Specifically:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Lua code has no network access.</li>
      <li>Disabled the following Lua/LuaJIT libraries:
      <ul>
        <li><code>io</code> - general filesystem access</li>
        <li><code>os</code> - OS operations, like executing commands</code></li>
        <li><code>debug</code> - various ways of poking around the Lua state</li>
        <li><code>jit</code> - alters settings of the JIT compiler</li>
        <li><code>package.loadlib</code> - directly loads functions from C
        libraries</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Modified Lua's <code>require</code>, <code>loadfile</code>, and
      <code>dofile</code> functions to only load Lua source files from
      BerryBots data directories.</li>
      <li>Disabled support for loading LuaJIT bytecode.</li>
      <li>Disallow running any packaged ships or stages that contain symbolic
      links.</li>
    </ul>
    
  </div>
  <div class="faq_q">
    Can't you make a nonviolent programming game?
  </div>
  <div class="faq_a">
    <p>I gave some serious thought to avoiding the idea of having bots shoot at
    each other in any way. I decided that the gameplay dynamics of it are just
    too interesting to avoid it entirely. That said, I have a couple points to
    offer:
    <ul>
      <li>I've been careful to keep the violence squarely in the "cartoon
      violence" realm. The game uses simple 2D vector graphics. There are no
      detailed explosions or anything photorealistic. Lasers and torpedos are
      not typical real world weapons. Ships don't "die", they are "destroyed"
      (and can be revived!).</li>
      <li>By default, ships can only move, A stage has to enable "battle mode"
      to allow ships to shoot at each other. A lot can be done with battle mode
      off - many of the sample stages do not use battle mode. If you're averse
      to spaceships shooting each other, limit yourself (or your students /
      children) to these types of stages.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="faq_q">
    What version of Lua is BerryBots using?
  </div>
  <div class="faq_a">
    <p>BerryBots uses a modified <a href="http://luajit.org">LuaJIT</a> 2.0.x,
    which itself is a highly optimized version of Lua 5.1 with some features of
    5.2. The changes made for BerryBots are centered on security and packaging
    of ships and stages.
